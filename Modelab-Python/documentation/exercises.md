## Week 2

### 04_missing_values 
### Exercises:  
    - Create a new column called "TA_DIC_ratio" that is the ratio of TA to DIC
    - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the "TA_DIC_ratio" for each season
    - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the "TA_DIC_ratio" for each season and area
    - Save the results to an Excel file called "TA_DIC_Season_Areas.xlsx"
